            a Web3 Quest and event platform, and will use their service to do a
            series of fitness related contests where we can reward our NFT
            holders OP provided they completed the tasks. The Quest3 incentives
            would be the first of their kind, essentially the NFT community’s
            equivalent to DeFi’s incentivized liquidity mining as I see it. For
            verification we are able to review submissions manually through the
            platform before rewards are dispersed. We plan to use some of the
            funds to set a reward of 1 OP for users who follow our social media
            channels. This direct marketing approach is a more effective and
            efficient use of capital by leveraging Web3. The result should be
            exponential growth and awareness, and a positive network effect. We
            would like to have a series of weekly quests over a period of 2
            months, beginning with a contest that rewards holders who have done
            a certain amount of steps, followed by a pushup challenge the next
            week, etc.

            We would allocate 90% of our OP allocation to these fitness
            challenges. The remaining 10% will help with our development costs.
            Thus far the project has been funded with 100% of our teams own time
            and capital and we have fixed costs such as domain/ipfs hosting that
            we’d love to offset. We will be using our own NFTs and Eth from
            royalties after the incentives are complete to continue these
            challenges and keep our community swole.We already have a strong
            following and track record of Discord and Twitter challenges. So we
            hope to use the funds strategically, as we’ve done before to drive
            volume to Optimism. NFT projects such as OptiChads in turn benefit
            Public Goods funding and the ecosystem as a whole.
