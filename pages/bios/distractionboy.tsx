            Fed up with the monotony of his web2 job and looking for a way to
            contribute to the OP NFT scene, he found Dicaso in the OptiPunks
            discord looking for people to help build a new collection that would
            donate 50% of its mint to Retroactive Public Goods Funding.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the months that followed, DistractionBoy built the website that
            facilitated the OptiChads genesis mint and served as a reference
            point for the Fitness Challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time DistractionBoy has gotten to know Dicaso, Millynish, and
            some of the other OptiChads staff members in real life and prides
            himself in actually having made new friends in the crypto space. He
            facilitates many of the team&apos;s collaborations with press
            releases and timely updates to the website, reaches out to L1 maxis
            and invites them to the superchain (and I guess Arbitrum), and
            researches new tech.
